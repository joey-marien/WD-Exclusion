# WD-Exclusion

This is a quick & dirty tool I made to add an exclusion path to Windows Defender.

## Information

When I was doing research on malware that disables anti-viruses I noticed that nobody just adds an exclusion for their executable.
While this may be (and probably is) a dumb idea, it works!
At the time of uploading this it is undetected and could be used for malicious purposes.

### Options/features

* Detect admin privileges
* Add a specified folder to the Windows Defender exclusions list
* Possibility to download and execute a file undetected
